A project developed using React.js. The purpose of this project is to develop a simple website that can be used to visualize an O(N^2) and an O(NlogN) sorting algorithm. These algorithms are Insertion Sort and Quick Sort. Additionally, once these algorithms are sorted, a binary search can be executed and visualized. This website can be ran on both PC or mobile (although there a currently some minor visual bugs on mobile).
